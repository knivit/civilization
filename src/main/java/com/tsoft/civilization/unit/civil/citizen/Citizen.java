/**
 * Population is a term used in Civilization V to represent the Citizens living in each of the population centers (cities) of the civilization.
 * Citizens are the main laborers of the empire, working the tiles of terrain around the city to obtain yields, as well as the specialist slots.
 * As such, they're paramount for the productivity of each city, and the empire as a whole.
 *
 * Population is represented by a number that indicates both the number of Citizens inhabiting a city and its general size.
 * This number is not literal, and is instead used for gameplay purposes (for example, an individual Citizen can occupy a single job slot).
 * If a city has 1 Population, or a single Citizen, it does not mean there is literally only one person living there;
 * it means the city is a very small village.
 * A city with a Population of 10 is a concentrated urban area, and a city with a Population of 20 or more is a major metropolitan area.
 * The size differences between cities are represented graphically as well â€“ whereas a newly founded village will barely occupy the middle of its tile,
 * a sprawling metropolis will appear to spill over into neighboring tiles.
 *
 * Each new city starts with a Population of 1, or 1 Citizen.
 * This means that it can work one nearby tile (in addition to the tile the city is placed upon, which is worked for free).
 * It can subsequently grow or shrink its Population according to the rules of Food consumption and distribution,
 * though it will always have at least 1 Citizen.
 *
 * Apart from producing tile yields, citizens also contribute to Science production at
 * the rate of 1 Science per Citizen without additional buildings.
 *
 * Each unit of 1 Population produces 1 Unhappiness, and so happiness serves to cap the number of citizens in the empire.
