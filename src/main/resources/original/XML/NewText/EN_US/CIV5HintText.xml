		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_13">
			<Text>A good road net can be extremely useful when your civ is under attack. For example, under the right circumstances ranged units with movement of 2 can advance, fire on enemy units and retreat behind stronger units - all in one turn - if they're on roads.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_14">
			<Text>Three moderately-powerful units of any type can capture virtually any city - no matter how mighty - unless the city is defended by additional units outside of the city.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_2">
			<Text>Construct Temples, Theatres, and other cultural buildings to gain access to advanced civics.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_3">
			<Text>Once a space is within a civ's borders it will always be in that civ's borders. The only way to wrest control of that space from the civ is by capturing or destroying the city controlling the space.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_6">
			<Text>Scout units can see one space farther than other early-era units and thus make excellent watchdogs. In addition to sending them out to explore the world, consider planting them on hills on the periphery of your empire.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_7">
			<Text>Never take a knife to a gunfight.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HINT_8">
			<Text>Keep an eye on your empire's Happiness. If your empire is Unhappy, your cities will pretty much stop growing until you acquire new sources of Happiness.</Text>
